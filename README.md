# FluffyFellows


## Description
FluffyFellows is a fun and interactive way to learn about pet responsibility. Players choose a pet, care for it, and earn coins. The game features 2 pets and dynamic pet states that respond to player choices.


## Installation
To get FluffyFellows up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/MichalKuthan/FluffyFellows.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Install dependencies:
`npm install`
(This installs all the necessary packages, including Express for server-side routing and Mongoose for database interactions.)

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
Express: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
Mongoose: An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
Nodemon: A utility that monitors for any changes in your source and automatically restarts your server.
